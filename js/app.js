		review	: 	'In this first-ever complete recording of Grechaninov&pos;s Passion Week, Chandos has pressed into service the mighty Kansas City Chorale, augmented by the Phoenix Bach Choir., in movements for double chorus and presumably elsewhere in this virtuoso work as well. Recorded at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in Kansas City, this Direct Stream Digital Super Audio CD simply has marvelous sound that reproduces the very breath of the farthest chorister. Chandos&pos; Passion Week, Op. 58, is a slam-dunk for those who love great choral music; it is a major addition to the recorded repertoire for chorus and is a telling example of what &quot;high holy minimalism&quot; sounds like when it isn&pos;t minimal.',

		review	: 	'For starters, this CD contains some of the finest a cappella singing I&pos;ve ever heard. Its sumptuous choral tone must be heard to be believed. It is done by two professional choirs from seemingly unlikely places, the combined Kansas City Chorale and Phoenix Bach Choir. I have raved about their prior recordings both separately and in combination but this release possibly tops anything they&pos;ve done, at least in terms of ineffably beautiful a cappella choral sound. There is no question that Charles Bruffy, the conductor of both the Phoenix Bach Choir and the Kansas City Chorale, is one of the most talented choirmasters currently working anywhere in the world. He may very well be the US analog to Eric Ericson of Sweden or Laurence Equilbey of France. Certainly his choruses&pos; style is more European than English, and it is to the English Chandos label&pos;s credit that they have added these two Bruffy-directed choirs to their roster.',

		review	: 	'There is a tight quasi-symphonic unity about the piece that possibly derives from Grechaninov&pos;s admiration for Wagner. When one adds to this the outstanding use of &quot;choral orchestration,&quote it is clear that The Seven Days of the Passion is a milestone in the history of Russian choral literature. It&pos;s clear, too, that Charles Bruffy and his singers understand this fully, rejoicing in the work&pos;s technical challenges and its vast range of colour, and pacing it superbly.',

Pitch, intonation and ensemble are exactly where they need to be. Although there are miles and miles of soft singing on this disc, not once do the singers lose their tonal focus, and the intensity of the sound actually seems to increase as the dynamic level decreases. To pile miracle upon miracle, Chandos has given the singers engineering which is both limpid and powerful. This would be a good disc with which to test your systemâ€™s high-end response.',
